I joined [Geometric Perception and Intelligence Research (Gorilla) Lab](https://www.scut-gpi.cn/), in 2019. I am a Ph.D student supervised by [Prof. Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site/). I received Master degree from Shenzhen University. I worked on hypespectral image processing (classification) with [Prof. Sen Jia](http://jiasen.tech/jiasen/) and Prof. Daming Shi. My current research focuses on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, robust pattern recognition, and adaptable machine learning. I am also a reviewer for many top conferences and journals, including ICML, NeurIPS, ICCV, TIP, TMLR, IEEE J-STARS, GRSL etc.
